Regularization is a technique used in machine learning, particularly in linear regression models, to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization. In the context of a multi-variable linear regression model for house price prediction, regularization methods such as Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression can be applied to enhance model performance.

Techniques Covered
Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization): Utilizes the lambda parameter to control the extent of regularization by penalizing large coefficients.
Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization): Incorporates the lambda parameter to encourage sparsity and feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero.

Key Features
- Code Examples: Provides clear and concise examples of implementing regularization techniques with the lambda parameter in popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.
- Demonstration Notebooks: Includes Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the impact of different lambda values on model performance and the resulting coefficient shrinkage.
- Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to evaluate the effectiveness of regularization.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Demonstrates techniques for tuning the lambda parameter through cross-validation to find the optimal regularization strength.
